        <h1>THE DESTINATION.</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>…The destination is still a long way ahead. Nobody in the car really pays attention to the surroundings. They are too happy to be aware of what’s really around. They are all friends, and they are on a long tour. The journey began in broad daylight, at a time when you could not open your eyes wide open. Now it’s night, and no matter how wide you open your eyes, nothing can be seen at this hour…, especially at the place they are currently traveling in. The road they took now is broad enough to fit four vehicles simultaneously. But the only car that is on road is this one. If not for this car, the road reflects nothing but darkness. It’s like as if darkness is born out of this way. And this is the way they wanted to go. Too often, young people do things that they regret later. It is the Impulse that they can’t easily resist, and with that comes everything that they wish to not have in their lives.  And these guys are no different…</p>
        <p>The way is absolutely silent. One could hear the wing flapping sound of birds in there. And these people are a breach of silence, and darkness in this way, at this time. The high volume of songs, the blinding lights, and the very presence of these strangers disturbed the environment that is untouched by any live human for 10 years now. 
            They move on… with the same fervor as they started the journey.  As for them, they sensed nothing wrong in the route. Nothing caught their attention. They are all immersed in the stories that one of them is telling. And as any bunch of young people, these are also into horror stories in the nighttime. Maybe the absence of light ignites that part of us that we despise later on. And that part is not far away for these 5 boys.</p>
        <p>The road is flanked by trees on both sides. It is as if the light of their car is producing the road ahead; beyond the light, nothing could be seen. As time went on, it got darker and darker, and one of them got a feeling that they are just floating in infinite nothingness.</p> 
        <p>Now, they all are a bit tired of stories and are feeling drowsy from the journey. The last time they stopped the car was almost 5 hours ago… well before they entered this nothingness. “I should take a piss, man! Pullover…” said one of them. The car stopped, and everyone got down for a moment. They put on their flashlights, as the surroundings were completely dark. And they were all pissed by the road, whistling. “This place is a little weird… it’s almost 2 hours since we got this way, and not a single soul can be seen! A bit scary to be honest…”, said someone. Others agreed. “So where should we stay tonight?” “Not here for sure… lets's travel a bit longer and see…”. 
            All of them agreed with this. </P>
        <p>They went a little further. Nothing still. Nothing that could let them take a rest for the night. With heavy hearts, they moved on. The surroundings are even darker now. The one driving lost all the energy to drive anymore, and said “Come on guys… this seems like forever! Let’s stop here and wait until the morning. I need some rest or if anyone can drive now, take the seat.” All of them are on the brink of sleep, and no one is ready to take the driver’s seat. They discussed for a little while and decided to stop there itself until they are hit by sun rays again in the morning. They finally decided to stop there… by the roadside. The car stopped. Lights off. They now belonged to darkness. The night they are engulfed by.</P>
        <p>Time went by...<br>
            All that time one of them was really trying to sleep, but he couldn’t. Perhaps some people can’t sleep peacefully in places unfamiliar with others! So he opened his eyes. Just sat like a statue for a minute or two… and checked his phone. No signal. As he didn’t expect otherwise, he wasn’t disappointed with that. He just opened his gallery to pass some time. He did this for quite some time, and soon he came across a photo in which he was with his father… taken well before the tragic missing of his father. He let that photo stay on his screen for some time. A drop of tear rolled down his cheek without his consciousness. He badly missed his father as much as he loved him. Before long, he turned off his phone. He looked outside. NOTHING. He felt like they are just flying in nothingness.</p>
         <p>Time went by….<br>
            Still, he couldn’t sleep. He just wanted some fresh air. So, he decided to get down. Luckily, he sat in the corner; he got down without disturbing anyone. The moment he was down, he felt so good. After all that journey, this gave him peace. For the surroundings are so dark, he had to use the flashlight of his phone. As the weather is quite pleasant at that time, he decided to walk a little bit from their vehicle.</p>
